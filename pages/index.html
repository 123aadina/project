          Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
          kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football
          normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
          word is used. Sports commonly called football include association
          football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football
          (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian
          rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league);
          and Gaelic football.[1][2] These various forms of football share to
          varying extent common origins and are known as football codes. There
          are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric
          ball games played in many different parts of the world.<span

            >Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the
            codification of these games at English public schools during the
            19th century.[6][7] The expansion and cultural influence of the
            Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British
            influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[8] By the end of
            the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:
            Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of
            local traditional football games in order to maintain their
            heritage.[9] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England,
            becoming the first of many professional football competitions.
            During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football
            grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.
